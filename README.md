- 👋 Hi, I’m @chanwinyee
- 👀 I’m interested in so many things!
  - Professionally, I find flow in building scaleable data solutions from data tables to data visualizations. 
  - Personally, I love learning how to uplevel my art and technical skills. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build a website, paint using oil paints and water colour, and I'm dabbling a bit in arduino.
- ✨I am looking to collaborate on:
  - How to hack a Kindle Touch + PiZero into an e-ink text editor (like a homebrew FreeWrite)
  - How to write creative short stories
