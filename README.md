- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chanwinyee
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in so many things!
  - Professionally, I find flow in building scaleable data solutions from data tables to data visualizations. 
  - Personally, I love learning how to uplevel my art and technical skills. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build a website, paint using oil paints and water colour, and I'm dabbling a bit in arduino.
